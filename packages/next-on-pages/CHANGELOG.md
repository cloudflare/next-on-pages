# @cloudflare/next-on-pages

## 1.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 8fe72f1: make CLI arguments parsing more flexible

  prior to this change the CLI arguments parsing was not too flexible and forced a specific style

  For instance the only way to provide an argument for the `outdir` option was to pass it using `=` as in:

  ```
  -o=./my-dir
  ```

  or

  ```
  --outdir=./my-dir
  ```

  these changes make the CLI arguments parsing more flexible and don't enforce a specific style
  (`--outdir ./my-dir` now also works as you'd expect it to)

- 20d0e0d: Fix `_not-found` functions only for applications using the App Router

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/pull/418 we introduced a workaround
  that would delete invalid (nodejs) `_not-found` functions during the build process

  Although the workaround is valid for applications using the App Router it is not
  for applications only using the Pages Router, so make sure that it is only applied
  when the former is used

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 61d0a2f: print warning in case developers are using a different package manager to run @cloudflare/next-on-pages
- 1e73555: Fix route intercepts causing 404s for the non-intercepted route.
- 1e73555: Fix route intercept modals not getting all the parameters for a route.
- b7f9225: improve unhelpful error message (so that instead of `[object Object]` it prints the actual error message)
- bc216b4: Improved support for newer version of Next.js with the suspense cache through trying to handle soft/implicit tags properly
- 8ece962: fix external middleware rewrites

  Currently Middleware rewrites (`NextResponse.rewrite()`) assume that the rewrite destination
  is on the same host as the application, meaning that the following operations would work as intended:

  ```ts
  NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/rewrite-dest', request.url));
  ```

  while something like this would not:

  ```ts
  return NextResponse.rewrite(
    new URL('https://my-customer-rewrite-site.come/rewrite-dest', request.url),
  );
  ```

  Remove such assumption and allow such external rewrites to take place (as they do on Vercel)

- bc216b4: Fix old version of Next.js not updating a cache entry properly due to not receving the correct shape they expected.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 888ae85: Add support for using a KV to implement the Suspense Cache via naming convention

  With this change users can have their suspense cache implemented via a KV binding, in order to
  opt-in to such implementation they simply need to make sure that their application has a KV binding
  named `__NEXT_ON_PAGES__KV_SUSPENSE_CACHE` (the next-on-pages worker will pick up such
  binding and use it to implement the suspense cache instead of using the default workers cache API).

### Patch Changes

- f364224: Set `x-vercel-sc-host` request header for older versions of Next.js for the suspense cache.
- d7b34cc: Falling back to header if cache tags are not given from fetched CachedFetchValue object. The change was introduced from Next.js 13.5+.
- dbe2c78: Update the matcher for the temp fix for a Next.js bug to match more chars.

## 1.7.4

### Patch Changes

- 9d5db04: Fix broken `/__index.prefetch.rsc` rewrites that were being rewritten to `/__index` (and 404ing) due to to rsc suffix stripping that we do.

## 1.7.3

### Patch Changes

- c83d125: Temporary hotfix for `vercel/next.js#58265` so that rendering in Next.js >= 14.0.2 works.
- bf57ec9: Fix prerendered `next.config.js` `basePath` root infinite redirect due to Cloudflare Pages handling of `/{path}/index`.
- bf57ec9: Fix nested `index.rsc` routes not generating a non-index override.
- 9b290cb: Output more information about the sizes of identifiers and functions, as well as all of the consumers of each identifier.
- bf57ec9: Fix the `/_not-found` invalid function hack to work with `next.config.js` `basePath`.
- ee237f3: Patch the fetch function inside the fetch handler, instead of in the global scope.
- bf57ec9: Fix unncessary invalid function at the root not being discarded when using `next.config.js` `basePath` option.

## 1.7.2

### Patch Changes

- a1091b1: bump package-manager-manager to 0.2.0

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 5b44784: bump package-manager-manager to 0.1.3

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 2423529: Add new static error page that informs users when they forgot to set the `nodejs_compat` flag.
  This should be clearer that the simple text message we've been providing previously (which is
  still being used as a fallback in case the new page is not available for some reason).

### Patch Changes

- 29d3041: improve routing by following more closely Vercel's routes matching logic
- 69efaa5: Reinstate the use of the package-manager-manager package introduced in #474 and temporarily removed in #475,
  this fixes the bug that was caused by the package by bumping the package itself (where the bug has been fixed)
  and adding appropriate catches when the package methods can throw (in case other unexpected issues arise in the
  future)
- ab83858: Changes to the x-vercel-ip headers to bring their structure in line with deployments to Vercel.
- 6600d2a: fix wasms not always getting imported when necessary

  Details:
  when dealing with wasms that have more than 1 consumer, when we collect
  the wasm imports to prepend for a specific edge funcion we're always
  re-setting the array of wasm imports instead of appending them, this
  causes edge functions to always only consider the last wasm
  import, the changes here fix such behavior

## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 072af87: Temporarily revert the change to package-manager-manager so that the bug fix in the latest release for new next.js versions can still be releases, while a fix for #474 is investigated in the meantime.

## 1.6.2

### Patch Changes

- cd2f7ee: correctly handle newly introduced .prefetch.rsc suffixes
- 5b4a5b7: improve package managers and package handling by using the package-manager-manager third party library
- b585099: Avoid using the Vercel custom config hack for Bun package manager support when a version of the Vercel CLI that supports Bun is used.
- 628f6bb: Ignore invalid nodejs i18n functions with valid alternatives.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 0168496: Fix named capture groups in `has` entries in the build output config not applying to route destination paths.
- f764fff: Fix `process.env` not being enumerable due to being a proxy.
- 1e25a97: Fix dynamic parameters with an underscore leading to an incorrect param being provided.
- c06b437: Normalize the injected function entrypoints for Windows.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 291bfde: Support for the internal fetch (suspense) cache, and `next/cache` data revalidation.

### Patch Changes

- cb32baf: avoid the default is not a function unclear error

  if there is some issue evaluating a lazy loaded edge function
  its default export ends up not being a function and that results
  in an unhelpful error like the following:

  ```
   TypeError: u.default is not a function
  ```

  slightly improve the user experience by catching such error and
  letting the user know that something went wrong with the edge
  function's evaluation:

  ```
   Error: An error occurred while evaluating the target edge function (<edge-function-path>)
  ```

- 291bfde: Stop the `cache` property in fetch requests causing internal server error.
- 4570aa6: add vercel@31 as a peer dependency
- c788def: fix package version detection for yarn
- fe6ea04: Add vercel@32 as a peer dependency

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 7da1fd8: fix package version detection not correctly working with yarn v1
- 5bfbbe1: Add workaround so that people can use standard not-found routes in their app directory applications

  The problem is that:

  - if there's a static not-found route in app dir, that generates a serverless (edge incompatible) function (\_not-found)
  - if there's a dynamic not-found route in app dir, that generates two serverless (edge incompatible) functions (\_not-found, \_error)

  The workaround being introduced here is:

  - if there's a static not-found route in app dir, we delete the generated \_not-found serverless function
    (which is not needed as we can just fallback to the static 404 html)
  - if there's a dynamic not-found route in app dir, we can't actually fix it but provide a warning for the user

  Besides the above the `no-app-not-found-runtime` eslint rule has been introduced to try to help developers avoid
  the issue

- 7f94fd2: Apply search params to rewritten URLs in matching.
- 7da1fd8: install vercel yarn dev dependency only when not already present

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ea98a8f: Support for defining an `_routes.json` file in the root of the project. Entries in the root's file are copied over to the generated one in the output directory.
- 9faf701: add warning indicating that usage under windows is not advised
- c6621c6: Support for using Bun as a package manager in projects.

### Patch Changes

- 3affd17: Normalize injected import paths for builds done on Windows machines.
- 226d562: Specify the `framework` is `nextjs` in the Vercel `project.json` file.
- 5aefce5: watch mode only on file changes

  only watch for file changes instead of watching for all possible changes (such as directories additions/removals, etc...),
  making sure that we don't rerun the build process unnecessarily

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 660ed5e: Optimize build output function processing to increase next-on-pages' build speed by 2-4x.
- 11afe0a: Group code block identifiers by the function files that they are consumed in. This reduces the total number of unique files created for identifiers that are used in multiple functions, like Webpack chunks or manifests.
- ee6b7dc: add user-agent header to outgoing fetch requests

  mimic Next.js' behavior of setting (if not already present) a `user-agent` header set to `Next.js Middleware`
  see: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/6705c803021d3bdea7fec20e5d98f6899e49836d/packages/next/src/server/web/sandbox/context.ts#L318-L320

  this helps making next-on-pages more consistent with Next.js on Vercel
  (it and can solve issues in which such header is necessary, as for example when making Github rest api calls,
  see: https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/issues/376#issuecomment-1628416988)

### Patch Changes

- 660ed5e: Prevent prerender files from overwriting in the output directory when the file hashes are the same.
- 660ed5e: Completely avoid processing rsc functions due to them being identical to non-rsc functions.
- f08f2b9: Fix `next.config.js` rewrites unintentionally redirecting the user instead of rewriting the request.
- 6c28128: Fix middleware redirects not always bailing out of the routing stages.
- 9734795: clarify that Yarn Plug'n'Play can't be used simply because not supported by vercel
- 551fa05: Fix the `/_next/static` exclusion in `_routes.json` being incorrect when the directory is not in the root.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 619beea: bundle assets produced by the Vercel build and make them accessible via fetch

  Vercel/Next can allow access binary assets bundled with their edge functions in the following manner:

  ```
  const font = fetch(new URL('../../assets/asset-x', import.meta.url)).then(
    (res) => res.arrayBuffer(),
  );
  ```

  As you can see in this `@vercel/og` example:
  https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation/og-image-examples#using-a-custom-font

  This sort of access to bindings is necessary for the `@vercel/og` package to work and might be used in other packages
  as well, so it is something that we need to support.
  We do so by making sure that we properly bind the assets found in the Vercel build output into our worker
  and that fetches to such assets (using blob urls) are correctly handled (this requires us to patch the global `fetch` function)

- 76a8bb4: Fix multiple search params with the same key not being preserved

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- cb7ab43: Support for images via `/_next/image`, falling back to the raw image URL when image resizing is not available.

  Due to limitations with Cloudflare Pages, it is not currently possible to send requests through image resizing.

### Patch Changes

- cf5234a: Prevent the build process from modifying the `.vercel/output/functions` directory.
- 92c865b: deduplicate Next.js manifests

  Currently in our functions files we have end up having a number of Next.js internally used manifest objects duplicated.
  These manifests increase as the number of routes increases making the size effects of the duplication quite problematic for medium/large applications
  (for small applications the manifest duplication is not as problematic).

  This change removes such duplication by making sure that we only include each type of manifest once and share such javascript object across the various functions instead (significantly decreasing the output size of medium/large next-on-pages applications).

- 505be1e: avoid extracting chunks when unnecessary

  As part of our lazy loading implementation (see https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/blob/main/docs/technical/lazy-loading.md)
  we extract chunks that are used by different routes into separate functions and import those functions in the route files, this allows
  us not to duplicate chunks code.

  This change here makes sure that only the chunks that are actually used by multiple routes get extracted as there isn't a real benefit
  in extracting into separate files chunks that are used by single routes, on the contrary it actually adds overhead and increases
  the number of files produced, which for large next-on-pages applications might be problematic.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f9cf97: Support for using a custom output directory for the generated worker and static assets, through a `--outdir` flag.

### Patch Changes

- f879ffd: Prevent middleware redirects applying search params.

  When a middleware function results in a redirect, the location header specified in the response is the full destination, including any search params, as written by the developer. Previously, we always applied search params to redirects found during the routing process, no matter what. This meant that we accidentally were applying search params to middleware redirects, which would alter the intended final destination. This change prevents that from happening.

- 3a95489: Fix middleware returning `new NextResponse` resulting in 404 for routes that don't exist in the build output.
- 2dceb75: Fix middleware being invoked multiple times in a phase during routing when there is more than one config entry.

## 1.1.1

### Minor Changes

- 2c87481: Display a summary about the build at the end of the build process.

### Patch Changes

- b1c3a33: fix --info showing [object Promise] for relevant packages instead of their versions
- a9b8c3c: Overwrite prerendered files if they already exist in the output directory.

  When using `--skip-build`, it would fail if a prerendered file already existed, so we need to override the files so that the build process can continue like normal. This was problematic as after the first build, the prerendered files would now exist in the output directory as static assets, preventing any additional builds.

- b1c3a33: fix vercel command not found issue

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1be5e72: Support for the `wildcard` option in the Vercel build output config.

### Patch Changes

- 783dc79: Added package.json to list of ignored files in watch mode to ensure compatibility with yarn (classic)
- fb818bf: Fix i18n locale index routes not matching for SSR'd index pages.
- 016b8d3: Fix `set-cookie` headers overriding when more than one is set, instead of appending.
- d835933: Prevent the route group stripping regex from removing intercept routes.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- f687d25: update the runtime error message so that it provides accurate up-to-date information
- ff90dde: Remove rsc functions from the worker output directory as we replace them with non-rsc variants in the config given to the router. This reduces the final bundle size.
- cb62938: Fix dynamic params not being derived correctly in some cases when running a page's function.
- d91b24b: Fix middleware not returning a response with `new NextResponse` and when there is no `x-middleware-next` header present.
- 7deb9d8: Fix non-index pages with trailing slash rewriting to /index for rsc requests.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 29b7547: improve no nodejs_compat flag runtime error message
- c0ecec3: introduce wasm support

  introduce wasm support by tweaking how the wasm modules are imported, what `vercel build` does is adding dynamic
  requires at the top of the func files, like for example:

  ```js
  // file: .vercel/output/functions/index.func/index.js
  const wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114 = require('/wasm/wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114.wasm');
  ```

  then such identifier is used in the rest of the file (likely only inside chunks), as in:

  ```js
      // file: .vercel/output/functions/index.func/index.js
      649:e=>{e.exports=wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114}
  ```

  the above can't work with next-on-pages because:

  - dynamic requires are not supported
  - when we perform the chunks deduplication chunks containing such identifiers will not find their declaration causing
    (e.g. a chunk file containing the `649` chunk code illustrated above won't know where `wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114`
    comes from and would just provide a runtime error saying that it is not defined)
  - `/wasm/...` isn't a real directory, just some sort of convention used by vercel, the wasm files are located in the same
    directory as the func file

  the adopted solution consists in:

  - copying the wasm files from their func relative locations into the `__next-on-pages-dist/wasm` directory
  - converting the func top level requires into standard relative esm imports, like for example:
    ```js
    // file: .vercel/output/functions/index.func/index.js
    import wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114 from '../wasm/wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114.wasm';
    ```
    so that any part of the func file will be able to reference the variable (so that this works with chunks deduplication disabled)
  - adding similar import statements to any chunk files that reference these wasm identifiers, like for example:
    ```js
    // file: .vercel/output/static/_worker.js/__next-on-pages-dist__/chunks/649.js
    import wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114 from '../wasm/wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114.wasm';
    var a = b => {
      b.exports = wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114;
    };
    export { a as default };
    ```
    (so that this works with chunks deduplication enabled)

- 3f05e81: update wrangler peer dependency (^2.20.0 -> ^3.0.0)
- 4f43b9b: Fix the issue of refetching the vercel package every single time when using yarn berry.
- 81bfcdb: allow any node built-in module to be statically imported correctly

  currently only static imports from "node:buffer" work correctly, other
  imports, although supported by the workers runtime, aren't handled correctly
  (such as "node:events" and "node:util"), fix this by making sure we handle
  imports from any of the node built-in modules

  > **Note**
  > some node built-in modules supported by the workers runtime still cannot be
  > correctly imported (like "node:path" for example), but this is because they
  > seem to be not allowed by vercel/next itself (so it's something unrelated to
  > next-on-pages)

- 95b1704: Fix non-dynamic trailing slash pages not matching when using `trailingSlash: true`.
- fd51777: remove hacks/workarounds for runtime bugs which are no longer needed
- 97c8739: fix getPackageVersion and use it to discern use of dlx

  fix the `getPackageVersion` function so that it doesn't wrongly produce `N/A` (thus
  improving the `-i|--info` results)

  the when running `vercel build`, use the function to discern if `dlx` should be added
  (for `yarn (berry)` and `pnpm` commands), ensuring that the vercel package is not
  unnecessarily re-fetched/installed

  > **Note**
  > Currently the aforementioned check (and build command) runs `next-on-pages-vercel-cli`
  > anyways that's a temporary solution, the changes here will also apply when we switch
  > back to the proper vercel cli package

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 3e2dad8: use and rely on AsyncLocalStorage

  previously we've been using the node AsyncLocalStorage in a non-breaking way but now we are committing
  to in and using it to store the global env variables as well

  this is a breaking change since moving forward all app running using @cloudflare/next-on-pages must
  have the nodejs_compat compatibility flag set (before not all needed that)

### Minor Changes

- 6fcb58b: make the experimental minification the default behavior and add an option to disabled it

  as part of this:

  - make `--experimental-minify`|`-e` a no-op argument which simply shows a warning which indicates that it is
    a deprecated option (we aren't removing the flag so that we don't break existing build scripts)
  - add a `--disable-worker-minification`|`-m` option to disable the minification of the \_worker.js script (which
    currently coincides with the experimental minification)

- e053756: add nodejs_compat runtime check

  add a runtime check for the presence of the nodejs_compat flag at runtime so that if developers
  forget to use such flag instead of receiving an internal server error they receive an error specifically
  telling them that they have not specified the flag

- 87e183b: New routing system runtime handling and implementation.

  Improves support for advanced routing with Next.js applications on Pages, through leveraging the Vercel build output configuration. The Vercel build output specifies the relevant routing steps that are taken during the lifetime of a request, and this change implements a new system that handles these steps.

- ea761b8: remove disable-chunks-dedup flag
- 86df485: Support for the internationalization (`i18n`) option in `next.config.js`, and locale redirects.
- 4d8a708: utilize Wrangler new capability of dynamically importing code to avoid the evaluation/run of javascript code
  when not necessary, reducing the app's startup time (which causes apps to often hit the script startup CPU time limit)

### Patch Changes

- b3ff89f: Function generation now includes all node modules instead of only node:buffer
- d81c2e3: add pnpm files to ignored list for watch mode

  add the following files to the list of files we ignore for watch mode:

  - `pnpm-lock.yaml`: for consistency since all the other lock files are ignored
  - `.pnpm-store`: to prevent potential infinite loops (https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/issues/212)
  - `_tmp_*`: to prevent infinite loops, this is needed because pnpm saves/deletes temporary files to get the relative path to its store (https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/3f85e75dad4f5560a17367e5faad5a387bd47d05/store/store-path/src/index.ts#L41), such files start with `_tmp_` (see: https://github.com/zkochan/packages/blob/f559aef5b63c2477dd72ce156f35d6111af780f6/path-temp/index.js#L6)

- bb23b60: Exit with non-zero status if vercel build fails in non-watch mode
- e2d2046: Fix the prerendered route handling for favicons.
- f1d76cd: Fix the prerendered route handling for generated JSON files.
- 701f0c2: Prevent infinite loops from occuring when checking phases during routing.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- a680db6: improve the error message shown when the Vercel build fails to make clearer that the issue is not next-on-pages related
- b07e3bc: Fix static route handling in the app directory and copy prerendered routes to the build output static directory.

  If an app directory project builds pages without specifying a runtime and has no server-side functionality, it defaults to generating static pages. These pages are in the form of prerendered routes, which are stored in the build output directory with prerender configs, fallback files, and functions. The functions it creates are not necessary and will be invalid nodejs functions as no runtime was specified, and the fallback files can instead be used as static assets for the pages.

- bddbe04: remove astring dependency

  remove the `astring` dependency and by doing so basically just create and edit
  javascript code via string manipulations.

  this should speed up the experimental minification (since we don't generate js code
  from ASTs anymore) and avoid potential bugs in the `astring` library (like #151)

  note that this is not the cleanest solution and that we should look into implementing
  more robust and stable javascript code handling via AST visiting and manipulations
  (but currently that has proven quite problematic since modern javascript libraries that
  allow such code modding have turned out to be very slow, significantly impacting DX)

- 9f5b83c: fix require-call typo preventing nodeBufferPlugin from properly working

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a159ed: add --info, -i CLI flag to print relevant details about the system and environment

### Patch Changes

- dc74ffe: fix: properly align invalid functions in error message
- e3b92c3: Ignore '.wrangler' directory in watch mode
- cf43f44: move the invalidFunctions check before the no-functions one

  currently if a build contains only invalid functions we'd be presenting a log
  saying that no function was found and simply return the static assets as if
  everything is correct, this is because we check for invalid functions only
  after checking if there are any (valid) ones, this change moves the invalid
  functions check so that is performed first, making sure that the described case
  successfully errors

- 758f588: improve AST checking

  improve the way we check for webpack chunks (for the experimental minification) by
  improving the AST types used and also make the AST checking more robust

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 3fa5b0e: Add colors to cli logs

### Patch Changes

- 6bb5dea: fix favicon breaking Next.js 13.3.0 app dir applications
- 3fe3a7d: fix small help message typos
- 752ae09: prevent buildSuccess check from crashing with a bad error message.
- 4dfd789: fix `require("node:buffer")` breaking applications

  Next seems to have started relying on `node:buffer` this nodejs module is supported by the workers
  runtime but it fails the \_worker.js build because `node:buffer` isn't recognized by esbuild (since
  we're not bundling for node), simply adding it to the externals option of the build command doesn't
  seem to work since it generates dynamic require calls which fail at runtime.

  So this change also adds an esbuild plugin so that the dynamic require calls to `node:buffer`
  get converted to requires to a new file which statically exports all entries from `node:buffer`,
  effectively removing the problematic require calls whilst allowing the use of `node:buffer` entries.
