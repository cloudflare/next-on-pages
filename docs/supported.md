# Supported Versions and Features

## Supported Next.js versions

Based on manual testing it seems like the latest Next.js version (`13.2.4` at the time of writing) is supported.

Earlier and Later versions might be only partially supported, we don't fully know.

> The team is very soon going to test various different versions and make improvements to the documentation on which Next.js versions are supported and to what degree.

    - ✅: Supported
    - 🔄: Not currently supported, but it's probably possible and we may add support in the future
    - ❌: Not supported and unlikely we ever will support this

- _1_ - **compression**: [Cloudflare applies gzip or brotli compression](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/speed/optimization-file-size/what-will-cloudflare-compress) automatically. When developing locally with Wrangler, no compression is applied.

- _2_ - **runtime configuration**: We could look into implementing the runtime configuration but it is probably not worth it since it is a legacy configuration and environment variables should be used instead.

- _3_ - **setting custom build directory**: Applications built using `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` don't rely on the `.next` directory so this option isn't really applicable.

- _4_ - **configuring onDemandEntries**: Not applicable since it's an option for the Next.js server during development which we don't rely on.

- _5_ - **exportPathMap**: Option used for SSG not applicable for apps built using `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`.

- _6_ - **React strict mode**: Currently we build the application so React strict mode doesn't work either way. If we can make strict mode work, this option will most likely work straight away.

- _7_ - **build indicator**: If you're developing using `wrangler pages dev`, we do hard refreshes so the indicator doesn't appear. If you run your app locally using `next dev`, this option works fine.

- _8_ - **Turbopack-specific options**: Turbopack is not currently supported on `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` (this might change in the future so we might reconsider the addition of this option).
