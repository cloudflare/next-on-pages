introduce wasm support

introduce wasm support by tweaking how the wasm modules are imported, what `vercel build` does is adding dynamic
requires at the top of the func files, like for example:

```js
// file: .vercel/output/functions/index.func/index.js
const wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114 = require('/wasm/wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114.wasm');
```

then such identifier is used in the rest of the file (likely only inside chunks), as in:

```js
    // file: .vercel/output/functions/index.func/index.js
    649:e=>{e.exports=wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114}
```

the above can't work with next-on-pages because:

- dynamic requires are not supported
- when we perform the chunks deduplication chunks containing such identifiers will not find their declaration causing
  (e.g. a chunk file containing the `649` chunk code illustrated above won't know where `wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114`
  comes from and would just provide a runtime error saying that it is not defined)
- `/wasm/...` isn't a real directory, just some sort of convention used by vercel, the wasm files are located in the same
  directory as the func file

the adopted solution consists in:

- copying the wasm files from their func relative locations into the `__next-on-pages-dist/wasm` directory
- converting the func top level requires into standard relative esm imports, like for example:
  ```js
  // file: .vercel/output/functions/index.func/index.js
  import wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114 from '../wasm/wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114.wasm';
  ```
  so that any part of the func file will be able to reference the variable (so that this works with chunks deduplication disabled)
- adding similar import statements to any chunk files that reference these wasm identifiers, like for example:
  ```js
  // file: .vercel/output/static/_worker.js/__next-on-pages-dist__/chunks/649.js
  import wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114 from '../wasm/wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114.wasm';
  var a = b => {
  	b.exports = wasm_fbeb8adedbc833032bda6f13925ba235b8d09114;
  };
  export { a as default };
  ```
  (so that this works with chunks deduplication enabled)
